# Adverse Event Reporting Analysis for Food and Cosmetics Using Power BI

This project involved the analysis of the CAERS dataset, which contains reports of adverse events and product complaints associated with foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. The aim was to create an interactive and informative Power BI dashboard that highlights key insights and trends in the data, facilitating better understanding and decision-making for stakeholders.

# Overview 

The project focused on cleaning and transforming the data, developing calculated measures using DAX, and designing a dashboard that presents the findings in an accessible and visually appealing manner. The dashboard offers insights into adverse event reporting patterns across various product categories, demographics, and outcomes, with the goal of improving product safety surveillance.

# Key Features of the Dashboard

1. Top 5 Products: Visualizes the most frequently reported products for adverse events.
2. Top 5 Industries: Shows industries with the highest adverse outcomes.
3. Adverse Event Trends: Displays trends in adverse event reporting over time.
4. Age Group Distribution: Breaks down reports by age group.
5. Summary Cards: Key metrics include total reports, event dates, and the most common symptom.

# Key Insights 

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Addressed missing values using the MEDIAN method, standardized data types, and removed duplicates to ensure data quality.
2. FDA Industry Analysis: Identified the industries with the highest adverse event reports, providing insights into potential risk areas.
3. Gender and Age Analysis: Revealed demographic trends, showing how adverse events are distributed across different gender and age groups.
4. Outcome and Symptom Analysis: Categorized outcomes and analyzed symptom frequency to understand the severity and nature of reported events.
